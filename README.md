# Handy Dandy Planner
UNCC Full Stack Flex Challenge 5

Handy Dandy Planner is a scheduling app that utilizes localStorage in order to save the user's appointments. 

## Installation

GitHub Repository: https://github.com/templarmanatee/Handy-Dandy-Planner/

GitHub Pages: https://templarmanatee.github.io/Handy-Dandy-Planner/

## Usage

By utilizing localStorage, the user can input text into any of the time blocks and click the save icon to save it for future viewing. The time blocks also indicate whether that appointment is past (in gray), current (in red), or upcoming (in green). 

## Review

In the creation of this project, I learned how to interact with datetime which has become invaluable for the rest of the bootcamp. I learned how to find localStorage within my browser and manipulate the data held within.
